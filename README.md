Here contains some projects that I did over the course of my master degree and during my ACL rehab period.

I have written a pdf report for each project. Please take a look if you are interested. 


1. [Nonlinear mixed effect model](https://github.com/thomastskng/Stats-Project/tree/master/Nonlinear-Regressions-and-mixed-effects-models)
----------------------------------
I worked on developing a mixed effect model for a sensor device, which was created by Silicon Valley engineers and manufactured by companies in Asia. The **non-linear mixed effect model** is in [here](https://github.com/thomastskng/Stats-Project/tree/master/Nonlinear-Regressions-and-mixed-effects-models/report3). The project is **still in progress**.   


2. [Netflow Traffic Flow Data Analysis](https://github.com/thomastskng/Stats-Project/tree/master/master-thesis)
---------------------------------------
This is my master thesis. I built a statistical model to monitor and check whether the behaviour of individual college IP is suspicious or not over the 2.5 months.
This contains some R codes that I used to perform parameter estimation for mixture models. 

3. [Bayesian Hierarchical Model](https://github.com/thomastskng/Stats-Project/tree/master/Bayesian-stats)
-----------------------------------
This is one of the projects which I believe is of paramount importance. This project essentially reproduce the Example 5.5 (combining information from Educational testing experiments in 8 schools) in Andrew Gelman's Book 'Bayesian Data Analysis'. 
Files under this project are a bit unstructured but I will try to improve it if I have time.
