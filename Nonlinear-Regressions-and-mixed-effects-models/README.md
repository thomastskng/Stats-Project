During my ACL rehab period, I took some time out to work on developing a
statistical model for parameter calibration in a sensor device. 

The *first report* adopts a standard linear regression model for parameter calibration, while the *second report* uses a regression model with a decay factor.

The *third report* involves fitting a nonlinear mixed effect model to model the process of each sensor device and this is **still in progress**, as the ultimate goal is not only about fitting nonlinear mixed effect models to the data but also about using nonlinear mixed effect models as a diagnostic tool to address the calibration issues.
