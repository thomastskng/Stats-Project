### NLME project (Still in progress)
A detailed report is provided in [nonlinear_mixed-effects_Regression_Project.pdf](https://github.com/thomastskng/Stats-Project/blob/master/Nonlinear-Regressions-and-mixed-effects-models/report3/nonlinear_mixed-effects_Regression_Project.pdf)

An plot from Exploratory Data Analysis is show below:

An image of Level I of the population model (grouped by calibration point (CP) level):
    The thin lines represent the data vectors, while the black lines represent the level I fitted values from the nonlinear mixed-effects model. The color changes across different CP levels.

To examine level 2 of the population model and compare it to level I, an example of the individual plots is shown below: 

The thick cyan line represents the fitted values of Level I model, which evaluates all the subjects under a particular CP level.

The individual (subject) data is represented by the unfilled triangles. 

The fitted values of Level II of the population are represented by the black color.
